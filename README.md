    LANGUAGE                      TOOL
   ------------------------------------------------------
1. JAVA   -----                                               MVN  tool
2. .net   -----                                              NUGET tool
3. JS/CSS   -----                                             BOWER COMPONENTS  & NPM tool



1. BOWER COMPONENTS  will have .rc and .json formats. 
[[[[[[  Npm and Bower are both dependency management tools.
But the main difference between both is npm is used for installing Node js modules but bower js is used
for managing front end components like html, css, js ]]]]

2. All the time we dont need to install a folder from online or add link from
                    * chttps://cdnjs.com/ (cz onlines lib may not work)
                    * npm  (will learn while learning node js)
                    * bower components
                    * Web jars (WebJars are client-side web libraries (e.g. jQuery & Bootstrap) packaged into JAR (Java Archive) files.)
                

  3. so,Downloading Bower components and putting it in our folder would help to use it without errors.
  
  https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/config
  
  https://bower.io/
                                                                                              
                                                                              
4.look in index.html, we have added bower components link and also have connected with controller js pages(this asusal)
